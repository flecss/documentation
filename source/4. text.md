# Text

The vast majority of user interfaces concerns text-based content. Thus, text represents an implacable design aspect.

## Font

At some point, choosing one or more font families is inherent to integrating their source files. With flecss, it is as imple as using a mixin:

``` scss
@include flecss.font("Roboto", "../fonts/roboto-200.ttf", 200);
@include flecss.font("", "../fonts/roboto-400.ttf", 400);
@include flecss.font("Roboto", "../fonts/roboto-600.ttf", 600);

@include flecss.font("Roboto Mono", "../fonts/-mono-all.ttf");  // weight: 100 900

html {
  font-family: "Roboto";
}
```

## Size

flecss emphasises space as an attribute to base its utilities on. Textsize is evidently space related, too – by its size. However, it scales in different magnitude than overall (white) space. Therefore, flecss' exponential spacing system also works on textsize, but with different coefficients. Fontsizes grow around the root fontsize (`1rem`). The root fontsize is `16px`, and `15px` below breakpoint `s`. Above breakpoint `xl` it is `17px`.

Moreover, headingsizes scale around `H5` (which is exactly `1rem`) based on the heading level (`LEVEL`): Other than by order, the exponent is `5 - LEVEL`.

Based on designated breakpoints, headingsize growth is increasingly discounted for smaller viewports. In numbers, by `10%` below the breakpoint `m`, `22.25%` below `s`, and `37.5%` below `xs`.

> The fontsize scale coefficient is desicribed by `$fontsize-scale-coefficient`, with a default of `1.125`, and the headingsize scale coefficient by `$headingsize-scale-coefficient`, with `1.375`.

## SCSS

``` scss
@use "flecss";

strong {
  @include flecss.class("text--l");
}

.icon {
  height: flecss.fontsize("l");
}

h1.display {
  font-size: flecss.headingsize(0);  // heading level 0 (‘h0’)
}
```
