## text

The `text` class allows to set text alignment. It is particularly with text based content that requires deviant text alignment.

| | |
| :- | :- |
| `_left` | Align text to the left. |
| `_right` | Align text to the right. |
| `_center` | Align text to the center. |
| `_justify` | Align text across the whole width. |

Idiomatically, alternation of fontsize would be achieved through an indiviual class (e.g. `font_large`). flecss is innovative with its all-in-one class name syntax. Thus, the `text` class can also be used to modify the fontsize, such as `text_center--xl`, or just `text--xl`.

### Example

``` html
<p class="text_center">
  Try <strong class="text--xl">flecss</strong> now.
</p>
```
