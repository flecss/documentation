## flex

The `flex` class represents flecss' key layouting class (pun intended). A flex layout should be designed for the large viewport. From there, the layout automatically adjusts to smaller viewports: The smaller the viewport gets, the less flex elments are shown per row. When to break was empirically decided under the assumption that the items contain text. Special cases are good to go with custom styles.

| :- | :- |
| `_1` - `_5` | `n` equal-sized content tiles per row with a homogeneous margin in between. The amount of elements does automatically reduce on smaller viewports. |
| `_horizontal` | Horizontal, center-aligned row of items. |
| `_vertical` | Vertical, left-aligned row of items. |
| `_left` | Two-fold layout growing flexible to the left. |
| `_right` | Two-fold layout growing flexible to the right. |
| `_across` | Horizontal, center-aligned row of items, with items distributed across the width, i.e. space between. |
