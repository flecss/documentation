## section & wrapper

The `section` and `wrapper` classes are vital to vertical layouting. In fact, each class represents a nestable container. A section stretches across the full width, with a small affixed horizontal content padding as a safety area. The wrapper has a limited width and is centered within a section, with an extra large affixed vertical content padding to separate stacked content in a linear vertical layout. Used in combination, the section-wrapper layouting classes provide simple yet powerful styling capabilities.

> The default vertical padding of a `.wrapper` is space order `xl`.
